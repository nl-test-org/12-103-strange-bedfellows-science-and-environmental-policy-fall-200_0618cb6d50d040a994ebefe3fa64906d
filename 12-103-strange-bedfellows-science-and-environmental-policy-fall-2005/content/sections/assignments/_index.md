Students are divided into groups at the start of the term. Each group focuses on an environmental policy issue. For the written assignments, students research their topic in depth in groups and write essays as individuals. The culmination of each case study is a group presentation. A sample set of essays and a final presentation on the pesticide DDT, representing one student's trajectory through the course, is provided here with permission, courtesy of Emma Bassein.

The assignments are due in the lecture sessions noted in the table below.
